How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? 
What value do you think it offers?
The working directory is just that, the directory that contains all the files 
currently checked out. The changes to these files may or may not be tracked by
Git, depending on whether or not they have been added and commited to Git.
Files in the Staging are have been marked for commitment to Git. This gives a way
to select the specific files from the working directory that will be commited on
the next commit command.
