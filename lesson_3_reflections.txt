When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
I'd want to use a remote repository for the following reasons:
1. So I can share the project with others
2. So I can access the project from several different machines

Describe the difference between forks, clones, and branches. When would you 
use one instead of another?
A fork is a copy of a repository out on a repro server such as Github
A clone is a copy of a repository on my local machine.
A branch is a labeled commit.
I'd use a fork if I wanted to base some new work off of an existing
project, but did not want my commits and pushes to be part of the original 
repo.
I've use a clone when I wanted to work on a project in a repo that I wanted 
to be able to push changes to.
I'd use a branch when I want to make changes to the local repo that are not
on the master branch.
